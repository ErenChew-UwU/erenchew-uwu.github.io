# Personal Creative Portfolio

Welcome to my personal creative portfolio!

I, Eren Chew ( Artist Nane: Shiroya, 白夜 ) as a curious learner exploring multiple creative and technical fields. Currently, I am learning in areas such as basic web development, databases, mobile app development, basic digital device repair, video editing, storyboard planing, and fundamental digital art.

This website showcases my personal works throughout my learning journey, and I will continue to expand and update it with more projects in the future.

Right now, it mainly focuses on **web development projects** and **artworks**, but in the future it will grow to include more exciting things like **games**, **animations**, and more creative experiments.
